# Nervespace Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

### Purpose
Nervespace is a mobile application designed to help users manage stress, restore balance, and enhance well-being through science-backed somatic practices. Unlike traditional meditation apps, Nervespace focuses on somatic exercises—such as breathwork, movement, and vagus nerve stimulation—to promote emotional resilience and physical recovery. The app targets individuals seeking practical, accessible tools to regulate their nervous system and improve their quality of life.

### Scope
The initial versions of Nervespace (up to v1.0) will prioritize delivering high-quality somatic sessions and daily reset routines, establishing a solid user base and core functionality. Future iterations (v1.2 to v1.5) will introduce advanced features like biofeedback integration, personalization, building on a stable foundation.

## Market Analysis

### Competitors
- **Headspace**: Offers robust meditation content but is often seen as expensive with limited free features.
- **Bend**: A user-friendly stretching app, though it lacks detailed instructions and has a restrictive paywall.
- **Balance**: Provides personalized meditation and a free trial but struggles with billing transparency.
- **Calm**: Popular for sleep and anxiety relief, yet criticized for aggressive upselling and repetitive content.
- **Endel**: Delivers unique soundscapes but faces technical glitches and high subscription costs.

### Opportunities
- Provide a generous free tier to build trust and attract users frustrated by restrictive models.
