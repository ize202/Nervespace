# NerveSpace Onboarding Flow (10-Screen Conversion-Optimized Journey)

**Goal:** Maximize emotional connection, user investment, and sunk-cost bias to increase conversion at a hard paywall.

---

### ✅ Screen 1: Identity Alignment
**🧠 Psychology:** Identity priming, self-perception theory

**Headline:**  
Welcome to Your Nervous System Reset

**Subheadline:**  
You’re here because you want to feel better — less stressed, more grounded, more *you*.

**Body Copy:**  
NerveSpace helps you reconnect with your body using powerful somatic techniques — breathing, stillness, and movement — to regulate your nervous system.

**CTA Button:**  
Let’s begin

**Psychological Effect:** Frames action as self-care, establishes aligned identity early.

---

### ✅ Screen 2: Emotional Anchoring (Why Now?)
**🧠 Psychology:** Goal priming, commitment bias

**Headline:**  
What brings you to NerveSpace today?

**Subheadline:**  
Choose what you’re seeking — this helps us shape your journey.

**Options:**
- 😣 I feel anxious or overwhelmed a lot
- 🌙 I struggle with sleep or tension at night
- ⚡️ I want more calm and focus during the day
- 🧘 I need a consistent way to reset
- 🤔 I’m just curious — but I know I need this

**CTA Button:**  
Continue

**Psychological Effect:** Forces the user to declare their intent — creates internal tension if abandoned later.

---

### ✅ Screen 3: Physical Problem Mapping
**🧠 Psychology:** Embodied cognition, emotional salience

**Headline:**  
Where do you feel the most tension in your body?

**Subheadline:**  
Your body holds what your mind suppresses. Let’s listen.

**Psychological Effect:** Physicalizes the pain. Makes the problem real and immediate.

---

### ✅ Screen 4: Time Commitment Framing
**🧠 Psychology:** Autonomy bias, habit intention

**Headline:**  
How much time can you give yourself each day?

**Subheadline:**  
We’ll build a plan that fits your energy, not the other way around.

**Options:**
- ⏱ 2 minutes — I want something quick I can stick to
- 🧘 5 minutes — I can make a little space

**CTA Button:**  
Continue

**Psychological Effect:** Makes them feel in control and invested — sets future expectation.

### ✅ Screen 5: Daily Reminder Setup
**🧠 Psychology:** Pre-commitment effect, soft habit loop, justification for notification permission

**Headline:**  
When should we remind you to reset?

**Subheadline:**  
A gentle nudge can make all the difference.

**Element:** Time Picker + Toggle Notifications

**CTA Button:**  
Set Reminder

**Push Prompt:** Native iOS/Android notification opt-in prompt

**Microcopy:**  
You can always change this later in settings.

**Psychological Effect:** Feels like planning a ritual — primes future app openings and reduces churn.

---

### ✅ Screen 6: Mood Check-In (Baseline)

We’ll come back to this after your first reset.

**Mood Options:** Emoji slider or mood ring (from Overwhelmed to Grounded)

**CTA Button:**
